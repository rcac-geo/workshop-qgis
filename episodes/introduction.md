## Introduction to QGIS

GIS stands for ‘Geographical Information System’. We can use a GIS application, such as ArcGIS and QGIS to manipulate spatial information. 

Why QGIS? It's free and flexible.

 1. Cost-free: Enjoy QGIS without any financial burden. It's completely free, no hidden fees.
 2. Free as in "Do It Your Way": You could extend QGIS to meet your specific needs, sponsor development or contribute your own code.
 3. Works where you work: Run QGIS on macOS, Windows, and Linux (so available for HPC Clusters). 
 4. Always getting better: Benefit from rapid development because anyone can add new features and improve on existing ones.
 6. Never get stuck: Access extensive documentation and a supportive community is there for help.
 7. Easily integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) and GeoAI.

## Open QGIS on Clusters

We can start QGIS via ThinLinc Client or Gateway. 

### Start QGIS via ThinLinc

Follow up with the Setup page, and connect with ThinLinc. To open QGIS as an interactive job, we could go to "Cluster Software" and select "QGIS", as the figure below:

Then select the "workshop" queue as below:

Then hit No as below:

Now input two cores and five minutes and hit Okay as below. You don't need to specifically request memory because memory will be relocated proportional with cores. But if you do, include unit such as "4G".

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

## Challenge 1: Look up QGIS version with Terminal?

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

```sh
module spider qgis
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Challenge 2: Start QGIS with Terminal?

How can you open QGIS as an interactive job?

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

```sh
module load qgis
qgis
```

### Start QGIS via Gateway

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

Inline instructor notes can help inform instructors of timing challenges
associated with the lessons. They appear in the "Instructor View"

## Figures

You can use standard markdown for static figures with the following syntax:

`![optional caption that appears below the figure](figure url){alt='alt text for
accessibility purposes'}`

![You belong in The Carpentries!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carpentries/logo/master/Badge_Carpentries.svg){alt='Blue Carpentries hex person logo with no text.'}

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

Callout sections can highlight information.

They are sometimes used to emphasise particularly important points
but are also used in some lessons to present "asides": 
content that is not central to the narrative of the lesson,
e.g. by providing the answer to a commonly-asked question.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


## Math

One of our episodes contains $\LaTeX$ equations when describing how to create
dynamic reports with {knitr}, so we now use mathjax to describe this:

`$\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}$` becomes: $\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}$

Cool, right?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Use `.md` files for episodes when you want static content
- Use `.Rmd` files for episodes when you need to generate output
- Run `sandpaper::check_lesson()` to identify any issues with your lesson
- Run `sandpaper::build_lesson()` to preview your lesson locally
