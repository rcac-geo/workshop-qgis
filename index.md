Welcome to Hands-on QGIS on HPC Clusters
---

Welcome to the Hands-on QGIS Workshop, where you'll learn to navigate and utilize QGIS, a powerful open-source Geographic Information System (GIS) on HPC Clusters.

What You'll Learn:

1. **Get Started with QGIS.** We'll cover the basics of opening QGIS on HPC clusters, loading, viewing, processing and exporting spatial data. 
  * Introduction
  * Open QGIS on Clusters
  * View Spatial Data
  * Process Spatial Data

2. **Project: 	Exploring landscape around Purdue.** Through a hands-on project, you'll learn to apply raster analysis techniques to explore the landscape around Purdue University. We will also cover installing plugins such as QuickMapServices and WhiteboxTools. Specifically, you'll work with: 
  * Slope
  * Hill shade
  * Stream and watershed
  * Raster to Vector

3. **Coding with QGIS: Python Console.** Take your analysis to the next level by learning how to write Python scripts using the QGIS Python Console. You'll learn how to automate geospatial tasks, such as replicating the same tasks you performed in the "Exploring Landscape around Purdue" project, but this time using code and submiting jobs to HPC clusters. By automating these tasks, you'll be able to streamline your workflow and increase efficiency.
