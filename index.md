Welcome to Hands-on with QGIS
---

Welcome to the Hands-on with QGIS Workshop, where you'll learn to navigate and utilize QGIS, a powerful open-source Geographic Information System (GIS).

What You'll Learn:

1. **Get Started with QGIS.** We'll cover the basics of opening QGIS on clusters, loading and viewing spatial data, and installing plugins such as QuickMapServices and WhiteboxTools.
  * Introduction
  * Open QGIS on Clusters
  * View Spatial Data

2. **Project: 	Exploring landscape around Purdue.** Through a hands-on project, you'll learn to apply raster analysis techniques to explore the landscape around Purdue University. Specifically, you'll work with: 
  * Slope
  * Hill shade
  * Stream and watershed
  * Raster to Vector

3. **Coding with QGIS: Python Console.** Take your analysis to the next level by learning how to write Python scripts using the QGIS Python Console. You'll learn how to automate geospatial tasks, such as replicating the same tasks you performed in the "Exploring Landscape around Purdue" project, but this time using code. By automating these tasks, you'll be able to streamline your workflow and increase efficiency.
