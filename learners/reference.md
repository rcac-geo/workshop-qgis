## Glossary


**CRS**

A CRS, Coordinate Reference System, is a system used to define the location of geographic features on the Earth's surface.

**DEM**

A DEM is essentially a 3D representation of a terrain’s surface.

**Layer**

A layer in QGIS is the visual representation of a single data file, used to build a map from overlaid information

**HPC Clusters**

HPC (High-Performance Computing) clusters are powerful computing systems designed to tackle complex computational problems that require massive processing power. They consist of interconnected computers (nodes) that work together as a single, unified system.

**Pixel**

A pixel, short for 'picture element,' is the smallest addressable element in a raster graphics image. It is a single sample of an image, typically represented as a square of a specific color

**Plugin**

QGIS plugins are small, add-on programs that expand the software's capabilities. Written in Python, they're easily build by users with intermediate programming skills.

**Raster**

Raster data represents geographic features as a grid of cells or pixels.

**SSH Key**

SSH keys are a secure way to authenticate to remote servers or services, replacing the traditional password-based authentication. They offer a much stronger level of security and are more convenient for automated tasks.

**Terminal**

A command-line terminal, also known as a console, shell, or command prompt, is a text-based interface used to interact with a computer's operating system. Instead of using a graphical user interface (GUI) with windows, icons, and menus, you interact with the computer by typing commands and receiving text-based output.

**Vector**

Vector data represents geographic features as points, lines, and polygons.
