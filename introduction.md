## Introduction to QGIS

GIS stands for ‘Geographical Information System’. We can use a GIS application, such as ArcGIS and QGIS to manipulate spatial information. 

Why QGIS? It's free and flexible.

 1. Cost-Free: Enjoy QGIS without any financial burden. It's completely free, no hidden fees.
 2. Free as in "Do It Your Way": You could extend QGIS to meet your specific needs. Sponsor development or contribute your own code.
 3. Works Where You Work: Run QGIS on macOS, Windows, and Linux. 
 4. Always Getting Better: Benefit from rapid development because anyone can add new features and improve on existing ones.
 6. Never Get Stuck: Access extensive documentation and a supportive community are there to help you.
 7. Easily integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) and GeoAI.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

Inline instructor notes can help inform instructors of timing challenges
associated with the lessons. They appear in the "Instructor View"

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

## Challenge 1: Can you do it?

What is the output of this command?

```r
paste("This", "new", "lesson", "looks", "good")
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

## Output
 
```output
[1] "This new lesson looks good"
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


## Challenge 2: how do you nest solutions within challenge blocks?

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

You can add a line with at least three colons and a `solution` tag.

## Figures

You can use standard markdown for static figures with the following syntax:

`![optional caption that appears below the figure](figure url){alt='alt text for
accessibility purposes'}`

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

Callout sections can highlight information.

They are sometimes used to emphasise particularly important points
but are also used in some lessons to present "asides": 
content that is not central to the narrative of the lesson,
e.g. by providing the answer to a commonly-asked question.

## Math

One of our episodes contains $\LaTeX$ equations when describing how to create
dynamic reports with {knitr}, so we now use mathjax to describe this:

`$\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}$` becomes: $\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}$

Cool, right?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Use `.md` files for episodes when you want static content
- Use `.Rmd` files for episodes when you need to generate output
- Run `sandpaper::check_lesson()` to identify any issues with your lesson
- Run `sandpaper::build_lesson()` to preview your lesson locally
